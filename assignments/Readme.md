## Git procedure
- `git pull` to download the latest changes from the remote repository
- `git add *` to add all the files to be later committed (from inside the desired directory) or `git add file_name` to add a single file.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit your changes to the local repository. Please add a "Commit message" that is representative of the work done. You can also add other messages to the commit by simply adding `-m "Second commit message"` and so on. The first message will be displayed as a commit title.
- `git push origin tur23-fall` to update the remote repository with the committed code (this may overwrite existing files).
